# Faceted Checkbox Tree

UI checkbox tree representing the category hierarchy provided by the response.json data.
The root category is `gender`, marked by the attribute `parent: "0"`.

> **Note:** Actions on checkboxes are distinct from actions that expand or collapse categories in a user interface, in order to provide a clearer path for users to intentionally perform their desired action without unintended consequences.
